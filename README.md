# advent-of-code-2023

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.

I chose to solve them with Typescript and Bun this year. No other special constraints this time, just trying to find a
solution for each puzzle, with a mix of good and bad solutions.

For each day there is a folder in `src` with the solution, tests and the input.

Tests can be run using `bun test`, all days with `bun start` and a specific day with `bun start <day>`.
